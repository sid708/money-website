<p>How money supports economic activity</p>
</header>

<article>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Money performs several important functions that make economic transactions smooth and efficient. Without these functions, modern economies would struggle to operate effectively.</p>

<h2>Medium of Exchange</h2>
<p>The primary function of money is to act as a medium of exchange. It eliminates the problems of barter by allowing people to buy and sell goods easily. Money is universally accepted, which makes trade faster and more efficient.</p>

<h2>Unit of Account</h2>
<p>Money provides a common measure of value. Prices of goods and services are expressed in monetary terms, making it easier to compare values and make economic decisions.</p>

<h2>Store of Value</h2>
<p>Money allows people to save purchasing power for future use. Unlike perishable goods, money can be stored without losing value immediately, although inflation can reduce its real value.</p>

<h2>Standard of Deferred Payments</h2>
<p>Money is used to settle future payments such as loans, salaries, and rent. This function supports credit systems and long-term contracts.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These functions make money essential to both individuals and businesses. By simplifying trade and supporting savings and investment, money strengthens economic stability.</p>
